Effective Campaign Selection for Restaurant Revenue Enhancement: A Comparison of Four Strategies

Summary

In this project, I aim to analyze the changes in restaurant sales based on different campaign methods and derive characteristics influencing sales to formulate effective marketing strategies. 
To achieve this, we collected sales data during the campaign periods. 
Each campaign lasted for 
- one week (from Monday to Sunday), and
- data were collected based on the restaurant's location (Seoul, Suburbs of Seoul, Provinces),
- lunchtime (11:00 AM to 3:00 PM), dinnertime (6:00 PM to 10:00 PM), and weekdays and weekends.

The results of the basic statistical analysis allowed us to understand the order frequency and amounts by region, as well as the characteristics of customer restaurant visits under different conditions. 
Based on the analysis, we could formulate marketing strategies to enhance restaurant sales and address any shortcomings.
